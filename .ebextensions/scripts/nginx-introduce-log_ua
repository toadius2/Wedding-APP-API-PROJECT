# Custom Configuration
# Author: Alexander Engel
# Date: 06.07.2016
# Purpose: Introducing variable '$log_ua' containing a boolean which indicates if the requests comes from a HealthChecker or not. We dont want to blow up the access_logs with HealthChecker requests.
# Additional Information: Also this script changes all lines with acces_logs [path] [configuration] to access_logs [path] [configuration] if=$log_ua;

map $http_user_agent $log_ua {

    ~HealthChecker 0;
    
    default 1;
}

# End Custom Config
